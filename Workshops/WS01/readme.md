# Workshop 1: The Bank Manager
## Due Date: Friday, May 27, 2022 before 23:59
## Workshop Objectives  
This workshop will test your ability to overload operators.

## Submission Policy
The workshop should contain ***only work done by you this term*** or provided by your professor.  Work done in another term (by you or somebody else), or work done by somebody else and not **clearly identified/cited** is considered plagiarism, in violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.

Every file that you submit must contain (as a comment) at the top **your name**, **your Seneca email**, **Seneca Student ID** and the **date** when you completed the work.

- If the file contains only your work, or work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

    > I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

- If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which parts of the assignment are given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from.**  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrong doing.

## Introduction and Workshop Tasks
You have been given five files: `BankMain.cpp`, `BankManager.cpp`, `BankManager.h`, `InvestmentAccount.cpp` and `InvestmentAccount.h`.

- `BankMain.cpp` has been completely implemented for you. 
- `BankManager.cpp` and `BankManager.h` are missing one function, the overload of the ** *==* operator**. 
- `InvestmentAccount.cpp` and `InvestmentAccount.h` are **mostly empty**. The only functions implemented are **PurchaseStocks** and **SellStocks**. The others have not.


	- For `BankManager.cpp`, implement the overloading of the ** *==* operator** such that true is returned if the names of the investment accounts are the same, false otherwise. Do not forget the function prototype in the header file `BankManager.h`
	- For `InvestmentAccount.cpp`, implement the overload of the ** *+=* operator**. This should add cash to the investment account. If the amount to be added is negative, print out the error message `"Invalid transaction"`. Do not forget the function prototype in the header file `InvestmentAccount.h`.
	- For `InvestmentAccount.cpp`, implement the overload of the ** *-=* operator**. This should subtract cash from the investment account. If the amount to be subtracted is negative, print out the error message `"Invalid transaction"`. If there isn't enough cash in the account, print out the error message `"Not enough funds in the account for <name>"`. Be sure to insert the name in the error message. See the sample run below as an example. Do not forget the function prototype in the header file `InvestmentAccount.h`
	- Implement the constructors for `InvestmentAccount`. The variables name and cash should default to `""` and `0.0` respectively.
	- Implement all getter functions for `InvestmentAccount`: `GetName()`, `GetValue()`, `GetStocks()` and `GetCash()`.
	- Implement the destructor for `InvestmentAccount`. **Be sure to wipe out all information**.

- To assist you with this lab, you might want to look at the following sample code about sports organizations which use operator overloading for comparisons and streaming output data: `Team.h` and `SportsOrganization.cpp`.

Be sure to document your code with the file name, your name and student number. Add comments throughout the code where necessary.


### Sample Output
A sample run is as follows:
```
    David Sands has $18900 in stocks and $1100 in cash.
    Kamla Patel has $27880 in stocks and $2120 in cash.
    Wing Chung has $44678 in stocks and $5322 in cash.
    
    Not enough funds in the account for Kamla Patel.
    David Sands has $18900 in stocks and $6100 in cash.
    Kamla Patel has $27880 in stocks and $2120 in cash.
    Wing Chung has $44678 in stocks and $15322 in cash.
    
    clients 2 and 3 are the same
```
## Reflection
Study your workshop solution, reread the related parts of the course notes, and make sure that you have understood the concepts covered by this workshop.
Create a **text** file named `reflect.txt` that contains the answers to the following questions 

1. Do you prefer the overloading of += and -= (ie *client[0] += 5000; *client[1] -= 5000;) or would you prefer it if InvestmentAccount had functions to add cash and withdraw cash? Why?
2.	Do you prefer the overloading of == (ie if (*client[0] == client3) {..} or would you prefer to call a function to compare two clients? Why?
3.	Why might it be necessary to wipe out all information in the destructor of InvestmentAccount?


## Submission

Test and demonstrate the execution of your program using the data given to you and make sure your code is generating output similar to the above example.

Please email five files: `BankMain.cpp`, `BankManager.cpp`, `BankManager.h`, `InvestmentAccount.cpp` and `InvestmentAccount.h` in addition to the `reflect.txt` to email address: <mufleh.al-shatnawi@senecacollege.ca>

	> **Late submissions will incur a 25% penalty each day.**

**:warning:Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Resubmissions will attract a penalty.
